<!--Compressed version of the Tiled TMX format-->
<!--The first layer shows the amount of total data entries, tree and tile entries in this order.-->
<!--The data itself is split into pairs. The first value shows how often the tile is rendered in a row. The second is the tile id.-->
<!--The highest repetition count is 256 to allow storing it in an unsigned 8bit integer. If a tile is repeated more often, it is split into several pairs.-->
<!--Tree layers always starts and ends with the tuple (256,65536). A single tree information is a quadruple.-->
<!--It consists of the tile id of the top left tree tile, its x/y position on the map and the amount of repetitions-->
